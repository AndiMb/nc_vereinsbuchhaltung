## [Unreleased]

## [0.27.0] – 2026-08-22

### New
- **README, manual and audit guide are now also available in English.**
  README.md, CHANGELOG.md (from this version onward) and HANDBUCH.md are now
  also available as `*.en.md`, with a language switcher at the top of each
  file. `info.xml` now carries `<name>`/`<summary>`/`<description>` in both
  languages, so the App Store automatically shows the right one. The manual
  served in-app (`/api/help/handbuch`) and the printable audit guide for
  auditors (`/api/help/pruefleitfaden`) now detect the user's Nextcloud
  language setting and serve English instead of German once it's set to
  English. The chapter deep links from the in-app help (HelpModal) now point
  to language-independent anchors (`section-<chapter>`) instead of slugs
  derived from the (then translated) heading text.
